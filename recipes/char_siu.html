        <h1>Char Siu (Chinese BBQ Pork)</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you’re new to char siu, it’s an extremely juicy, sweet, and savory pork dish that’s a popular entree on its own — and a pleasant addition to many different types of noodles, rice dishes, and pastries like char siu bao.
            <br>
            Char siu originally comes from Cantonese cuisine, and the word chā sīu 叉烧 literally means “fork roasted,” which is a nod to the traditional cooking method of skewering seasoned pork with long forks, and placing them in an oven or over a fire.

Although it’s considered a Chinese dish, many other Asian cuisines have integrated char siu into their own dishes — Thailand makes its own version of Chinese BBQ pork called kao moo dang and Japanese chashu gets its name from the dish, too.

In ancient times, char siu used to be made with boar or other available meats, but nowadays it’s almost always made with a fatty cut of pork.

        <p><strong>Basting Ingredients</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>44.4 mL honey</li>           
            <li>14.8 mL water</li>
            <li>1.8 mL red food coloring (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Prepare pork</h3>
            <p>Cut the pork shoulder (1361 g) into long slices, roughly about 1 inch thick. We'll aim to cut each slice with uniform thickness so they cook at the same rate.

                Afterwards, we'll repeatedly poke each side of each slice with a fork to help the pork absorb our marinade more effectively.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Prepare marinade</h3>
            <p>To a bowl, we'll add:
                <ul>
                    <li>22.2 mL garlic salt</li>           
                    <li>88.7 mL brown sugar</li>
                    <li>44.4 mL oyster sauce (Amazon)</li>           
                    <li>44.4 mL light soy sauce (Amazon​)</li>
                    <li>22.2 mL hoisin sauce</li>
                    <li>44.4 mL red wine</li>
                    <li>22.2 mL Shaoxing wine</li>
                    <li>1.5 cube red fermented bean curd</li>
                    <li>7.4 mL five spice powder</li>
                </ul>
                This amount can be adjusted based on the amount of pork you'll be making.

Mix the marinade until it's evenly distributed and smooth.

If you'd like a more rich, red color, you can add a few drops of red food coloring (1.8 mL).
            </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Marinate pork</h3>
            <p>Place the meat into a zip-top bag, pour the sauce in, and massage the pork for about 2 minutes so that the sauce is able to finesse its way into the meat. Afterwards, we’ll push all the air out of the bag and seal it. 

                Place the bag in the refrigerator, and let the pork marinate overnight, or at least for around 6 to 8 hours.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Prepare char siu for oven</h3>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 425° F or 218° C.

                Set up the baking pan by lining the bottom with aluminum foil (so it's easier to clean!), and place the baking rack on top of the foil.
                
                Using tongs, start laying out the pork on the baking rack and pan.
                
                Add 1 to 2 tbsp of water to the bottom of the pan to help generate some steam as the char siu cooks, and to help prevent the drippings from burning and smoking.
                
                Carefully place it in the oven.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Roast and baste char siu</h3>
            <p>Now, we’ll be removing the char siu periodically to baste it again with either our leftover pork marinade, or honey (44.4 mL) diluted with water (14.8 mL). 

                Here’s how you can split up the cooking time:
                
                <ul><li>Cook for 15 minutes and baste both sides with the pork marinade</li>
                <li>Cook for another 15 minutes and baste both sides with pork marinade again</li>
                <li>Cook for 10 minutes and baste both sides with the diluted honey</li>
                <li>And finally, we’ll turn the heat up to 450° F, cook for another 5 minutes, baste both sides with honey, and let it cool for a few minutes before cutting into it. </li></ul>
                In total, this is about 50 minutes in the oven.</p>
            <li><h3>Final touches, let cool, cut and enjoy!</h3>
                <p>Once the char siu has finished its last cycle in the oven, we'll baste each side with our diluted honey.

                    Let the char siu cool for about 5 minutes before cutting into it.
                    
                    And finally... enjoy!</p>
